# DPU_TRD_ZCU104
DNNDK DPU TRD for the ZCU104, we have build the "Demo Test" for the ZCU104. We followed the PG338 DPU TRD of ZCU102 to build the DPU TRD for the ZCU104 FPGA. We have tested and verified the result of the new DPU TRD on ZCU104. In this TRD we have Resnet50 of Convolutional Neural Network for teh application of image classification. For more details, please visit: PG338 and DNNDK reference can also be found at UF1327, Xilinx.
